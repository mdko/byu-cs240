	This Site tests the basic functionality of a cs240 webcrawler.
	The first thing that should work properly is parsing links.
	<h3><a href="./linktests/index.html">Link Tests</a></h3>
	Then, you should make sure that word parsing works.
	<h3><a href="./wordtests/index.html">Word Tests</a></h3>
	Last, you should make sure that description/summary parsing works.
	<h3><a href="./descriptiontests/index.html">Description Tests</a></h3>
	Then, use an HTML site to make sure robot-filter works.
	For each test, you should make sure your output is correct.
	
	This site doesn't attempt to test for everything, feel free to
	add tests as you see fit. You can download a tar file of this site
	from the project page.
