<h1>Absolute</h1>
We can't really test absolute using this site, because 
We don't know what the setup on each computer is going to be. But we
can test absolute links to pages that generally exist, but may not or may be read only,
and shouldn't be parsed anyway, so this is also partly a test of non html parsing, and
out of scope parsing.
