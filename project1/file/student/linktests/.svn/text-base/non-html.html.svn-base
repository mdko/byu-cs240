These links are to non-html files.  Don't try to hard to open some of them,
 because even thought they have different file extensions, they're really just the same
 plain txt file. 
 <ul>
 <li><a href="non-html.jpg">jpg</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html.mp3">mp3</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html.odt">odt</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html.cpp">cpp</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html.mov">mov</a></li>
 </ul>
 The following are all of the html endings explicitely mentioned in our spec. Once again, they really go 
 to the same basic html file.
 <ul>
 <li><a href="non-html1.html">html</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.htm">htm</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.shtml">shtml</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.cgi">cgi</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.jsp">jsp</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.asp">asp</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.aspx">aspx</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.php">php</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.pl">pl</a></li>
 <li><a href="non-html1.cfm">cfm</a></li>
 If your webcrawler knows how to recognize other html formats, thats fine. Just know that our passoff script
 doesn't recognize anything but these and so you may not pass. Just tell the TA's and show them the code that
 makes the decision and they should pass you off.
